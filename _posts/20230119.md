# Expression vs Statement

## Expression

At its core, an expression is a bit of JavaScript code that produces a value.

## Statements

A JavaScript program is a sequence of statements. Each statement is an instruction for the computer to do something.

Statements often have "slots" for expressions.

If logged, it's an expression, if not , statement or not valid.

expressions can't exist on their own. They're *always* part of a statement.

### in React

Jsx 에서 {} 안에 넣을 수 있는 것은 only expressions. Not statement.

==The squiggly brackets essentially **create an expression slot within our JSX.**==
그래서 If 문은 안되고 삼항연산자는 되는데 이는 JS 제약때문.

### wrap-up

Expressions are *always* part of a statement, even if that statement is otherwise empty. For example, the code below runs a loop *without* using a `for`statement, but it still includes an “empty wrapper” statement:

`data.forEach(item => console.log(item));`
